Open questions:

  - what is the complexity of concert-tickets-2.cc?

Important problems:

  - elevator-rides.cc (bin packing in O(N Ã— 2^N))
    Interesting that the problem becomes easier by calculating more information!

TODO:

  - implement min-stack / min-queue and add them to code library
    https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/stack_queue_modification.html
  - test with maximum-subarray-sum-II.cc
