Open questions:

  - what is the complexity of concert-tickets-2.cc?

  - maximum-subarray-sum-1.cc and maximum-subarray-sum-3.cc
    are extremely similar! can I explain the relation somehow?

TODO:

  - implement min-stack / min-queue and add them to code library
    https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/stack_queue_modification.html
  - test with maximum-subarray-sum-II.cc
