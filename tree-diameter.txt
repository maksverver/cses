TREE DIAMETER PROOF

First, some notation:

  - V denotes the set of vertices in the tree
  - abc denotes a path that goes from vertex a to b to c (in that order, but
    possibly visiting other vertices in between)
  - |abc| denotes the length of the path abc
  - D = the diameter of the graph, defined as max |vw| for v, w in V
  - far(v) = {all w in V such that |vw| is maximal}

Theorem:

For all u in V, for all v in far(u), for all w in far(w), |vw| = D.

If this holds, then we can find the diameter by starting from an arbitrary
vertex u, finding a vertex v farthest from u, and a vertex w farthest from v,
and then the diameter D = |vw|.

Proof:

We can trivially show that:

 |V| = 1 implies D = 0 (a single vertex with no edges: o)
 |V| = 2 implies D = 1 (two vertices with a single edge between them: o-o)
 |V| ≥ 3 implies D ≥ 2 (at least one vertex incident to two edges: o-o-o)

So we will assume w.l.o.g. that |V| ≥ 3 and D ≥ 2. First, assume that D is even.
Then we can define the middle m of a maximal path ab as the unique vertex such
that |am| = |mb| = D/2.

Lemma: all maximum paths in a tree share the same middle.

Proof by contradiction: suppose there are two maximum paths amb and cnd, where
m is the middle of ab, and n is the middle of cd, and m ≠ n, then there is a
path of nonzero length between m and n (the graph is a tree, which is fully
connected, ater all), so we can construct a larger path by taking mn, connecting
m to a or b, and n to c or d, constructing a path of length greater than D.

In other words, of the four possible paths: anmc, anmd, bnmc, bnmd, at least
one must be a valid simple path, and since |an| = |bn| = |mc| = |md| = D/2
and |nm| > 0, these paths all have length greater than D.

Example:

            b
            |
   a--o--n--m--o--d
         |
         c

Here, |ab| = |cd| = 4, but since n ≠ m, these cannot be maximum length paths,
and indeed we have |anmd| = 5.

Note that note that not all four solutions are possible, e.g. anmc or bnmc are
not simple paths (they cross the edge nm multiple times). But it's easy to see
that you can always connect n to either a or b, depening on whether n lies on
a's side of m or on b's side (and similarly with m and c or d).

So now we know that the middle is a unique vertex in the tree, consider the
tree rooted at the unique middle, m. That tree has height equal to D/2, and it
has at least two subtrees of height D/2 - 1, which contain the endpoints of a
maximal path passing though m. In fact, all vertices at height D/2 are valid
starting points of maximal paths, and the maximal paths are exactly the paths
vw where |vm| = |mw| = D/2 and v and w occur in different subtrees of m.

Visualization:

       m
      / \
     u   o
    / \   \
   w   o   v

I'm not going to prove this formally, but it's easy to see that the maximum
path starting from any vertex u must go up to m, and then down to a vertex v
in far(m). By the same logic, the maximum path from v must go up to m and down
to w in far(m), and we have |vw| = |vm| + |mw| = D/2 + D/2 = D.

Finally, we must extend this reasoning to the case where D is odd. This can be
done in two ways:

  1. When D is odd, define the middle as the midpoint of an edge. Similarly,
     we rooting the tree at m, the root is not a vertex but an edge with two
     subtrees of equal height D - 1/2. Example:

          middle
            |
            v
          o---o
         /     \
        u       o
       / \      |
      w   o     v

     And all the logic still works.

  2. We can split each edge into two edges by inserting a dummy vertex in the
     middle. This exactly doubles distances between original vertices,
     guaranteeing that the diameter in the new tree is even, and we can just
     divide that by 2 to find the diameter of the original tree.

     Example:

                                            a
                                            |
           a  (diameter 3)                  o  (diameter 6)
           |                                |
        b--c--d--e       becomes      b--o--c--m--d--o--e
              |                                   |
              f                                   o
                                                  |
                                                  f

This proof can also be extended to trees where the edges have variable (but
nonnegative) length.
